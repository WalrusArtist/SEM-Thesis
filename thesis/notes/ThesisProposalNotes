1. Introduction
    • Statement of the problem
    • Why it is important to conduct research about the problem, motivation, purpose
    • Key existing literature about the problem and why the problem is not solved or more
    work is needed
    • For the above three items, a minimum of 4 trustworthy references (in total) must be
      used in the introduction when describing the problem, why it is important etc.
    • In the introduction, describe briefly what the methodology will be and give a few
      details on how the study will be conducted. Are there participants? Who are they
      and why are they suitable for the study?
    • State the research questions (RQ(s)) and link them to the motivation.
        – State clear and concise research questions that will be investigated
        – State at least two research questions (main or sub research questions)
2. Related Work
    • Describes the results of other studies that are closely related to the study being
      proposed
    • Include the 4 references from the introduction, but add additional references, a minimum of 4 in addition.
    • Describes related literature in enough detail to understand why they are included in
      the section, but not in too much detail to distract from the key message.
    • Consider the use of sub-sections to organize the literature into topics.
    • This section could contain both related work – work closely related to your topic –
      and background – work that the reader needs to understand your topic. If both are
      present, differentiate between the two.
    • It should be clear why this work needs to be done, how does the existing literature,
      either individually or in groups, not sufficiently solve your problem of focus.
3. Acknowledgement
