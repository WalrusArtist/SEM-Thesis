\section{Introduction}
Continuous Integration (CI) has become an integrated part of collaborative software development and DevOps practices. CI automates the quality of code checks, tests and integration of code changes in collaborative environments. The benefits of CI brings early detection of issues, fast feedback loops, increased code quality, reduced integration risks and continuous improvements. Famous examples of CI services include Jenkins, Travis, CircleCI and GitLab CI/CD \cite{b1}. GitHub Actions (abbreviated as GHA) was introduced to the public in 2019 as an alternative CI service for GitHub repositories. GitHub introduced its marketplace for sharing automation tools in an effort for developers to reuse workflow components \cite{b2}. \\ 
The so called "Actions" refers to automated workflows triggered by specific events within a repository, including committing changes, opening pull requests, or creating new branches \cite{b14}. These workflows streamline development processes by automating tasks and enhancing efficiency. GitHub's integration of GHA allows developers to define custom task sequences in response to events, simplifying collaboration and promoting a seamless development experience. \\
The growing popularity of GHA is immense, with more than 20 million GitHub Action minutes used per day on average in 2023. Leading to a 169\% increase of usage to automate tasks in public projects,  pipelines and more\cite{b3}. Given its popularity,  the increasing usage of GHA has lead to an emergence of its own ecosystem \cite{b4}.  According to Decan et al. \cite{b4}, the growing ecosystem of GHA bears similarities to reusable software libraries distributed by package managers such as npm, Cargo, RubyGems, Maven and PyPI among others. Where these ecosystems are well known to suffer from variety of issues such as obsolescence \cite{b5},\cite{b6}, dependency issues\cite{b7},\cite{b8},\cite{b9}, breaking changes \cite{b10}, \cite{b11}, and security vulnerabilities \cite{b12}, \cite{b13} to name a few. Decan et al. \cite{b4} go on to state "\textit{The GHA ecosystem is likely to suffer from very similar issues and these issues will continue to become more important and more impactful, as the number of reusable actions continues to grow at a rapid pace.}"\\
Given the concerns surrounding the GHA ecosystem, it is self-evident that developers will experience the effects of these issues.  Moreover, it's worth noting that not all Actions are available on the GitHub marketplace. Many developers create and maintain their own actions within local repositories, without making them available on the marketplace. Decan et al. \cite{b4} conducted an analysis of prevalent automation practices on GitHub and discovered that 43.9\% of repositories in their dataset reflected this behavior.\\
Due to its novelty, there is limited understanding of the challenges faced when implementing GHA.  
Therefore,  by systematically analysing StackOverflow posts, GitHub Discussions threads, tags, and other pertinent repositories, alongside the utilization of database queries and APIs, we aim to quantitatively examine the questions, topics, and answers surrounding GHA. This endeavor not only facilitates the clarification of prevalent issues but also provides insights into potential solutions and areas requiring further research and development within the GHA landscape.\\
Throught this research, we intend to answer the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item What are the prevalent automation practices and patterns observed within GitHub repositories, particularly concerning the adoption and utilization of GitHub Actions (GHA)?
    
    \item To what extent do developers rely on locally maintained actions within their repositories, as opposed to utilizing actions available on the GitHub marketplace, and what factors contribute to this distribution pattern?
    
    \item What are the primary challenges and issues encountered during the implementation and usage of GitHub Actions (GHA), and how do these challenges manifest in the evolving ecosystem surrounding GHA, particularly in comparison to established software library ecosystems like npm, Cargo, RubyGems, Maven, and PyPI?
\end{enumerate}

\section{Related Work}
Previous studies on the use of GHA have shown its significant rise in popularity after only 18 months of its official release, thereby slowly replacing the use of traditional CI/CD services in GitHub repositories \cite{b15}. Unlike traditional CI/CD services, GHA assists the software development processes by improving code reviews, team communication and internal repository management in addition to automating the build and test procedures of software \cite{b16}. This emerging popularity on the use of GHA and the increasing number of reusable actions that can be found on its marketplace led GHA to be considered similar to popular reusable software libraries distributed by package managers such as npm, Cargo, RubyGems, Maven and PyPI and so on \cite{b4}. However, this also means GHA is more likely to face similar problems that are currently encountered by these reusable libraries. Consequently, this would increase the chances of failure when building GitHub workflows in GitHub repositories leading to unsuccessful deployment of software packages. 

According to Decan et al. \cite{b4}, it is reasonable enough to consider GHA as its own software ecosystem consisting of more than 12K reusable actions. The paper claims that the GHA ecosystem deserves to be studied as all other reusable software ecosystems that have made progress in finding issues related to them. Since GHA is a new emerging ecosystem, there is a lack of research and studies that have been carried out to identify the challenges and issues that are encountered in GHA. Due to insufficient research and unaddressed questions regarding the GHA ecosystem, it is high time we set out to look for issues and challenges faced during the implementation and usage of GHA. Decan et al. \cite{b4} points out that the GHA ecosystem is exposed to similar challenges, such as obsolescence, dependency issues, breaking changes, security vulnerabilities, etc., that are encountered in well-researched reusable ecosystems. This section aims to briefly describe some of the issues pointed out above, using findings from related literatures, that are likely to appear in GHA.
\subsection{Obsolescence}

With each passing year, it is common for software code to go through regular changes to add features, fix bugs and so on. Sometimes functions or part of code becomes deprecated meaning they are outdated and no longer used; this usually happens after a long period of time when parts of the software code are replaced by an improved version. Generally, it is a good practice to avoid using deprecated code. Through the findings of Cogo et al. \cite{b6}, deprecated code used in npm packages has shown to give rise to risks such as incompatibility between two different dependant libraries, presence/absence of features, bugs, security vulnerability and more. Cox et al. \cite{b17} found that deprecated systems are four time more likely to suffer from security issues and backward incompatibilities than systems that are up-to-date. In the context of GHA, there is a high possibility that a significant amount of code that are reused are deprecated which might consequently lead GitHub workflows to fail building.
\subsection{Dependency Issues}
Software systems are usually developed using pre-existing and reusable packages such as modules, components, libraries, etc \cite{b7}\cite{b8}. Consequently, this leads to a large extent of dependencies between the reused packages and the original software code. According to Dietrich et al. \cite{b10}, software developers struggle to choose which versions of a given package to use and mentions that a handful number of software systems encounter runtime version conflicts due to incompatibility with the versions of other dependant packages. GitHub actions and workflows that depend on jobs from other Actions might fall on a similar pitfall of runtime version conflict and possibly other dependency issues.
\subsection{Security Vulnerabilities}
Software that depends on open source and free reusable libraries provided by package managers like npm are more likely to be exposed to security vulnerabilities. Zimmermann et al. [\cite{b12} quotes: \\
“The open nature of npm has boosted its growth, providing over 800,000 free and reusable software packages. Unfortunately, this open nature also causes security risks, as evidenced by recent incidents of single packages that broke or attacked software running on millions of computers.” \\
 According to Zimmermann et al. \cite{b12}, one way of exposing vulnerability on software is by publishing malicious packages and guiding the client to depend on these harmful packages. Since GHA consists of many open-source reusable Actions, workflow and GHA developers need to be extra careful on choosing what packages they depend on for building jobs. It is a good practice to depend on first-party packages and packages from trustworthy maintainers \cite{b12}.


\section{Research Methodology}
Start by stating the aim/purpose of the research study.

\subsection{Research questions and/or hypotheses}
Questions are relevant to descriptive, normative or census type research. (What are relevant factors? How many of them are there? Is there a relationship between them?) Hypotheses are relevant to theoretical research, and when you state hypotheses the reader is entitled to have an exposition of the theory that lead to them (and the assumptions underlying the theory).

In general, you should be prepared to interpret any possible outcome with respect to the questions or hypotheses. Try to visualize in your mind tables or other summary devices, which you expect to come out of the research, short of the actual data.

Describe the main research question(s) that you intend to answer with your thesis project. Use sub-questions if needed.

\subsection{Research methodology to be used}
Any research or problem solving requires a systematic approach with methods and procedures. Indicate the steps you will take to answer every question or to test every hypothesis indicated in Section III.A, to solve the problem that you are addressing. There are several research methods, e.g. design research \cite{b3}, case study \cite{b5}, and Survey \cite{b2, b4}, just to mention a few. Different research methods and procedures require different descriptions.

For example, for a survey, it becomes vital to describe sampling and instrumentation. The sampling, i.e. the population and how the sample has been drawn from that, needs to be described to clarify to what extent the findings of a study can be generalized to people or situations. You shall also outline the instruments you propose to use (surveys, scales, interview protocols, observation grids). For a case study or a design research, other aspects become vital.

\subsubsection{Data collection}
For all studies, you need to have a systematic approach for data collection. Outline the general plan for what data to collect, and how. This may include survey administration procedures, interview or observation procedures. Also, provide a general outline of the time schedule you expect to follow.

\subsubsection{Data analysis}
For all studies, you need to have a systematic approach for data analysis. Specify the procedures you will use to analyze your data. If coding procedures are to be used, describe these in reasonable detail. For evaluations, describe the criteria to be used in reasonable detail.

\subsection{Threats to Validity}
A limitation identifies potential weaknesses of the study. Think about your analysis, the nature of self-report, your instruments, and the sample. Think about threats to external or internal validity that may have been impossible to avoid or minimize and explain these.
