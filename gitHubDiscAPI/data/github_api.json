When this container is running in our development or production environment, we use a private-public key pair for setting up our NoSQL handle.

In my recent PRs #95, #96, #97, #98, #99 and #100, I implemented the process to bump the version and trigger a release on PyPI and GitHub for every new tag.\r\n\r\nFor releasing the lib on PyPI, I want to use the workflow shown in the three .bat files, i.e. I just want to use Twine. I translated this into a GitHub Actions workflow in #100. For this workflow to succeed, I require the credentials for PyPI. You do not have to leak the credentials to me; I can use them from GitHub's secrets. You just have to store them there. As I assume that you use username and password, can you persist the following GitHub secrets: `PYPI_USERNAME` and `PYPI_PASSWORD`?\r\n\r\nThe following steps will then be the ones used for releasing to PyPI.\r\n\r\n```\r\n      - name: Build dist\r\n        run: |\r\n          python -m build\r\n\r\n      - name: Test dist\r\n        run: |\r\n          python -m twine check dist/*\r\n\r\n      - name: Deploy dist\r\n        run: |\r\n          python -m twine upload dist/*\r\n        env:\r\n          TWINE_USERNAME: ${{ secrets.PYPI_USERNAME }}\r\n          TWINE_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.PYPI_PASSWORD }}\r\n```",

You can also leverage Github Actions to publish directly to Steam using [this action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/steam-deploy).",

With the addition of d365bap.tools, there are now at least 4 repositories that in regards to building and releasing the PowerShell modules, essentially do the same thing (or should do the same thing). While it will take some time consolidating it all, I think it is worthwhile. The current approach of eventually (for some repos very eventually \ud83d\ude04 ) updating each repo individually on an ad hoc / as needed basis feels cumbersome and error prone.\r\n\r\nThat said, when comparing the current actions of d365bap.tools with d365fo.tools, I noticed several differences, both in the actions and the PowerShell scripts used by them.\r\nThe main thing seems to be the validation, which for d365fo.tools is done in 4 steps (general unit tests, public functions unit tests, internal functions unit tests and individual unit tests), while d365bap.tools only has 1 step (which seems to correspond to the steps 1 and 4 of general and individual unit tests of d365fo.tools).\r\n\r\nBefore I dive deeper into that, I'd like your feedback on whether this seems worthwhile to you as well. \r\nAnd if so\r\n- should the validation for all modules follow the seemingly more sophisticated d365fo.tools approach?\r\n- what should be the name of the repository that holds the consolidated actions? \r\n\r\nFor my current experiment on this, I went with the name [d365.psmodule-alm](https://github.com/FH-Inway/d365.psmodule-alm) (alm as in application lifecycle management), but I do not really care for it.\r\n\r\n> \\* Could we enable organization discussions for topics like this where multiple repositories are affected? This would require creating a profile repository named \".github\" (see https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/customizing-your-organizations-profile#adding-a-public-organization-profile-readme) and then enable the organization discussions feature with that repository at https://github.com/organizations/d365collaborative/settings/discussions",

Pretty awesome! (We're fans of Cloudflare hosting too - looking forward to taking model.earth to Cloudflare Page as we integrate Observable with [Chatbot UI](https://github.com/mckaywrigley/chatbot-ui).)\r\n\r\nIf you don't use the Github Action setups using deploy.yml described in the posts below, here are several ways to create a site from the static files in your \"dist\" folder without adding deploy.yml:\r\n\r\n1a.) Remove dist/ from the .gitignore file.\r\n1b.) Point GitHub pages at your repo.\r\n\r\nThe resulting URL includes \"/dist\"\r\nhttps://[account].github.io/hello-framework/dist\r\n\r\nFor the sample above, you'll see a 404 error if you don't include \"/dist\" in the URL.\r\n\r\n2.) You can place the dist files in the root of a repo or in a \"docs\" folder (\"docs\" is the only subfolder GitHub Pages lists. Is there a way to tell GitHub Pages to point into the dist folder?).\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT: Add an empty .nojekyll file to the root directory (if you're not using deploy.yml), otherwise your Github Pages will be broken. Jekyll is the default page renderer for GH pages, and it ignores directories that begin with an underscore. Thanks [Philippe Rivi\u00e8re](https://github.com/Fil)!\r\n\r\n3.) In Github, under Settings > Pages > Build and Deploy, choose \"Deploy from branch: Source\" and activate the static.yml file.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nIf selecting GitHub Pages  and \"/docs\" prevents the error: \"docs:build\" not found error in deploy.yml with the hello-framework site, BUT the site still has broken formatting and no navigation -- try adding an empty .nojekyll file to your docs folder. (You'll probably see raw code because the docs folder in the hello-observable repo contains src files.)\r\n\r\nWhen you choose \"Deploy from branch\", the source choice will disappear.\r\n\r\nHere's the more complex deploy.yml used for the documentation site from the bottom of the Getting Started page:\r\nhttps://github.com/observablehq/framework/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy.yml\r\n\r\nCheck out the deploy.yml examples from Mike below for running hello-framework on GitHub Pages and Cloudflare.",

Notifying @alecloudenback. The variability in runtimes appears to only be for NumPy based models, these results don't seem worrisome\r\n\r\n### can better benchmarks solve the problem\r\n\r\nI am sure some life actuarial workloads take longer than 50 ms. So then a 10ms variance won't be a concern anymore if we can find a heavier model.\r\n\r\n### What is a good model\r\n\r\nI have no clue about economic assumptions, but understand mortality tables and lapses okay. How can the benchmarks become a collection of runnable models that adhere to a standard that practicing actuaries would find valuable?\r\n\r\n### Containers\r\n\r\nSomething called \"Apptainer\" is popular for HPC testing, compatible with docker. So these heavier benchmarks might not even have the source code entirely contained in this repository. This repository might report on results of various published containers, and be an index into all the different implementations people might have. And then people can run the containers.\r\n\r\nI would probably start submitting pull requests to lifelib with my implementations and having them live there for example.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

                    "body": "Disclaimer: Firstly, I want to mention that all of this writing is from my perspective, trying to contribute to your open-source project. I am from Mexico, and I speak Spanish, natively. Moreover, I have been speaking English for 8 years at work (I lived for 3 years in Columbus, Ohio).\r\n\r\n\r\nRegarding discussion [#274](https://github.com/Syllo/nvtop/discussions/274.).\r\n>  Although, what I should really do is bump it to Ubuntu 20.04 since the \"Standard Support\" for 18.04 ended last year.\r\n\r\n\r\nI wonder if it is necessary to add a CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Release) taking advantage of the benefits of GitHub Actions. Although, again, I don't know the context of why Ubuntu 20.04 is not used. In my experience, I could assume that it may be due to issues of uncertainty about whether it is going to compile in this new version of Ubuntu or some related issues.\r\n\r\n\r\nI've been reviewing the code very superficially, and these are my remarks regarding whether there are pros or cons to adding a CI/CD.\r\n\r\n- _Cons_: There is a folder with unit tests, but the last update was one and a half years ago. Therefore, it is not feasible to do a CI/CD, since the unit tasks are not being updated and there is no certainty whether the application will work or not.\r\n- _Pros_: You can create a cross-matrix of operating systems managed by GitHub ([Standard GitHub-hosted runners for Public repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners#standard-github-hosted-runners-for-public-repositories)). This could help to check whether it fails or not. Furthermore, also this matrix can use Docker and do it virtually as it is done at the moment.\r\n- _Cons_: A release is not being done with binaries; this code is downloaded to the user's machine and compiled to generate the binary file, documentation, etc. I noticed that [Arch Linux is using the source](https://gitlab.archlinux.org/archlinux/packaging/packages/nvtop/-/blob/main/PKGBUILD) generated from your [tag to download and build the binary](https://github.com/Syllo/nvtop/archive/3.1.0/nvtop-3.1.0.tar.gz), as this GitHub document shows: [Source code archive URLs](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/using-files/downloading-source-code-archives#source-code-archive-urls).\r\n\r\nFinally, I don't have a strong opinion regarding the application or not for the CI/CD for your project.",

That config file is now included in version control and completely throws off my local development:\r\n\r\n```\r\n---\r\nBUNDLE_PATH: \"/home/runner/work/repo-name/repo-name/vendor/bundle\"\r\nBUNDLE_DEPLOYMENT: \"true\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs there a way to set a *relative* bundle path? I tried editing that file and changing the path to `./vendor/bundle`, and the workflow succeeds, but then it resets back to that same specific bundle path. OR is there a way to set a local path and then a different one for GitHub Actions? Or, maybe I need to delete the config completely, add `.bundle/config` to my `.gitignore`, turn bundler cache back on, and then run it all again?\r\n\r\nThanks for reading my rambling! Does any of this make sense? Thoughts? Suggestions?",

I will attempt to convey a reproducible example below.\r\n\r\nProject Directory Structure (within `your_project/.github/`):\r\n\r\n```\r\n.github\r\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 deployment\r\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 update_templates.sh\r\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 workflows\r\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 update_templates.yml\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `update_templates.yml` workflow contains:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nname: Update Templates\r\n\r\non:\r\n  schedule:\r\n    - cron: '0 0 * * *'\r\n  workflow_dispatch:\r\n\r\njobs:\r\n  update_templates:\r\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\r\n    steps:\r\n      - name: Checkout repository\r\n        uses: actions/checkout@v4\r\n\r\n      - name: Set up Python 3.11\r\n        uses: actions/setup-python@v5\r\n        with:\r\n          python-version: '3.11'\r\n\r\n      - name: Install dependencies\r\n        run: pip install -r requirements.txt\r\n\r\n      - name: Run Update Templates\r\n        run: bash ./.github/deployment/update_templates.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\nInitial `update_templates.sh` script content:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n#!/bin/bash\r\n\r\necho \"Hello World 2024\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter executing the script multiple times (2 to N iterations, where N is undetermined, but at which point the job's step `Run Update Templates` is cached), modify `update_templates.sh`:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n#!/bin/bash\r\n\r\necho \"Hello World 2025\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nUpon committing the modifications to the `master` branch, GitHub Actions continues to output \"Hello World 2024\" in the job log, ignoring updates to the script.\r\n\r\nThis issue presents a significant challenge in debugging complex workflows, as changes to scripts do not appear to be recognized by GitHub Actions, leading to potential misdirection and inefficiency. Highlighting this behavior is crucial for the development community, especially considering the eight hours personally invested in uncovering this problem.\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\n\r\nI have tried reproducing the issue with the setup above, with N as high as 10 and had no success, so I think the issue may arise under a more nuanced scenario.",

                    "body": "### Current behavior\n\nI am encountering a 403 Forbidden error when attempting to publish my project using semantic-release through GitHub Actions, despite having correctly configured both the GitHub All Access Token and the Automation NPM Token within my GitHub Actions pipeline.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Configured GitHub All Access Token and Automation NPM Token as secrets in GitHub Actions.\r\n2. Set up semantic-release in the GitHub Actions pipeline as per the official documentation.\r\n3. Triggered the workflow on a commit to the main branch.\r\n\r\n## Actual Behavior:\r\nThe publishing step returns a 403 Forbidden error, indicating a permission issue. However, when performing a dry run using the same token within the .npmrc file, publishing succeeds without any errors. This suggests that the tokens are correctly set and have the necessary permissions. Additionally, prior to integrating semantic-release, the GitHub Actions pipeline was able to publish to NPM successfully.\r\n\r\n## Additional Information:\r\n1. The first version of the package was published to NPM using GitHub Actions without semantic-release and did not encounter any permission issues.\r\n2. The NPM token has been verified to have the correct permissions by successfully publishing the package in a dry run with the .npmrc configuration.\r\n3. I have ensured that the tokens used are correct and possess the required permissions. This issue seems to arise specifically when using semantic-release in the GitHub Actions environment. Any assistance or insights into resolving this permission issue would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThe package should be published to NPM without any permission issues,

I debugged myself and saw that prior to building the image there was nearly 40GB of disk space. This makes me wonder whether resources except for Github Actions Cache  are shared b/w parallel jobs.\r\n\r\nHow many runners are  there in part of standard runner suite?\r\nWhat is its spec? I reckon its 16GB Ram, 4 core cpu intel xeon, 64GB diskspace\r\nAre concurrent jobs/workflows run in the same runner? If so, how can i prevent resource exhaustion?-will concurrency-group work?\r\n\r\n\r\n",

The documentation says this is by default, which I understand. But this is causing issues with PR's as checks won't be displayed in the merge section of the PR interface (or the checks tab). This would make it easy to overlook failed checls, and also prevent the PR to be merged in case of rules (as the checks don't pass (there arent any)). \r\n\r\nI found a work around, but it includes adding a deploy key to (each) repository, and use that key to commit to the repository. This feels like a hack, and I'm probably doing something wrong?\r\n\r\nThe exact scenario is actually coming from a closed issue on dependabot-core: bumping the version of your repository (package.json/pyproject.toml/etc) for Dependabot PR's with github actions: https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/issues/2048#issuecomment-785972222",

Here are issues and PRs that encompass most of the work: \r\n\r\n- #1460 primarily discusses ideas for GH actions we could install to make some lives easier. This issue isn't about replacing drone\r\n- https://github.com/gomods/athens/issues/1500 (issue) and #1544 (corresponding PR) is for unrelated work, but ended up requiring us to move to GH actions because of drone.io limitations\r\n- #1463 is a try to move to add a GH action to do much of what drone already does. I opened this, my goal was to start a discussion. Highlights of the discussion: https://github.com/gomods/athens/pull/1463#issuecomment-554063521 is where @marwan-at-work asks what value actions provides beyond things we already use, and the discussion continues from there.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I think we should move to GH actions wholesale for two major reasons:\r\n\r\n- We get a VM for each job we run (see [here](https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/virtual-environments-for-github-hosted-runners#about-github-hosted-runners) for details). This allows us to isolate jobs from each other, and is closer to the model we were used to when we were on Travis CI\r\n- You can run background containers by running the equivalent of `docker run -d ...`, instead of using services in drone or circle CI\r\n- We can expand to windows VMs in the future, if we ever decide to get off of appveyor. I'm not advocating for that, only illustrating flexibility\r\n\r\nSince we've discussed actions v. drone/others in a few places, I'd like to centralize that discussion here.\r\n\r\ncc/ @marwan-at-work @robjloranger @twexler @chriscoffee ",
